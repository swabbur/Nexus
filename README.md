# Nexus
A cross-platform C++ implementation of networking and distributed computing related design patterns, build with [CMake](https://cmake.org/), tested with [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest), and styled based on the Pitchfork Layout ([PFL](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork)) and the style guide for python code ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)).

Do not forget to pass the `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON` option to CMake to enable unit testing.
